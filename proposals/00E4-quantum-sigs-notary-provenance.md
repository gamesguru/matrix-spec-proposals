# MSC 00E4: Notary provenance for post-quantum server keys

This draft contains notary observations, detached notary provenance bundles, and
TLS 1.3 compact provenance material split from the archived 00E1 draft, plus the
[Key minting Proof-of-Work](#key-minting-proof-of-work) mechanism. The version
of that mechanism here supersedes the plain SHA-256 key identifier construction
still on record in the now-frozen 00E1 draft: this file is normative for FN-DSA
key minting and observation going forward. The body below is intentionally
copied nearly verbatim in places and still needs normal MSC integration text.

#### Key minting Proof-of-Work

Homeservers and notaries that support this MSC MUST require a valid
co-generation proof-of-work for every newly generated FN-DSA key body — the
initial minting of a server's first FN-DSA key and every subsequent key-body
rotation — before accepting or attesting to that key. This requirement is
unconditional: there is no exemption for TOFU, notary-sourced, or
otherwise-trusted key objects, and no implementation-level opt-out. A receiving
server or notary MUST reject an FN-DSA key object that lacks a valid proof for
the `fn-dsa-key-minting` resource below, regardless of whether the accompanying
Ed25519/notary authentication is otherwise valid.

The proof is a non-interactive, cacheable stamp produced by the origin. It is
not issued separately by each receiver. The proof MUST be carried inside the
corresponding FN-DSA key object as the `pow` field. This placement is part of
the Matrix signing object, so the stamp is covered by the origin's server-key
signatures, included in `server_key_package_sha256`, and preserved by notary
redistribution without special handling.

**A valid `pow` does not, by itself, prove private-key possession.** `S(nonce)`
and every input to it — the public key body, `server_name`, and the nonce — are
public values; anyone who has observed a public key (their own, or one copied
from another server's response) can mint a valid co-generation proof for it. The
proof's only job is to rate-limit and anti-spam-gate key minting and rotation;
it is not an identity credential. Possession of the FN-DSA private key is
established exclusively by the FN-DSA self-signature: once a server publishes an
FN-DSA key, its `/_matrix/key/v2/server` response MUST include an FN-DSA
self-signature in the `signatures` field, keyed by that key's `short_key_id`,
alongside the existing Ed25519 signature. Receiving servers and notaries MUST
verify this self-signature before trusting the FN-DSA key, independently of and
in addition to verifying `pow`. Both checks are mandatory and neither
substitutes for the other: a syntactically valid `pow` on a key the origin does
not hold the private key for MUST still be rejected, because the response cannot
carry a valid FN-DSA self-signature without the private key, and a validly
self-signed key without a valid `pow` MUST still be rejected per the requirement
above.

Unlike a plain hash of the public key, the key's identity digest here is itself
proof-of-work-bound: it is a function of the raw public key body, key metadata,
and a nonce, and that same digest seeds the Cuckoo Cycle graph. This forces key
generation and proof-of-work to happen together — an attacker cannot grind
candidate public keys cheaply and mine a proof for the winner afterward, and
cannot mine graphs in advance of choosing a key, because no valid digest, and
therefore no valid graph, exists until a specific candidate key is fixed.

**Identity-binding digest.**

```text
cogen_stamp = {
    "action": "fn-dsa-key-minting",
    "public_key": "<unpadded-base64-fn-dsa-512-pubkey>",
    "server_name": "example.com"
}

S(nonce) = Keccak-256(
    canonical_json(cogen_stamp) || uint64_le(nonce)
)
```

where `canonical_json` is Matrix Canonical JSON serialization,
`uint64_le(nonce)` is the prover-chosen nonce (`0 ≤ nonce < 2^64`) as 8
little-endian bytes, and `||` is byte-string concatenation. `key_id` — the
identity digest used throughout this MSC family to name a specific key body — is
defined as `S(nonce)` at the nonce for which the origin mints a proof, not as a
plain hash of the public key alone. `short_key_id` remains the first 20
base64url characters of `key_id`, unpadded. `key_id` is a Keccak-256 output
under this proof class, not a SHA-256 output.

```json
{
    "fn-dsa-512:<short_key_id>": {
        "key": "<unpadded-base64-fn-dsa-512-pubkey>",
        "pow": {
            "algorithm": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckoo-cycle-42-29-keccak256-cogen",
            "nonce": 8137226,
            "solution": [123, 456, 789, "..."]
        }
    }
}
```

The verifier reconstructs `cogen_stamp` from the enclosing key response's
advertised public key and `server_name` rather than receiving it on the wire,
computes `S(nonce)` using the supplied `nonce`, and MUST check that the
enclosing key's advertised `short_key_id` equals the first 20 base64url
characters of `S(nonce)` before evaluating the puzzle. If it does not match, the
proof MUST be rejected without evaluating the graph.

**Graph derivation.** A given graph contains a 42-cycle only with some
probability, so the prover iterates the nonce until both the identity digest is
acceptable and the resulting graph is solvable. The 32-byte `S(nonce)` is
interpreted directly as four little-endian 64-bit words `k0..k3` forming the
SipHash-2-4 key. The bipartite graph has `2^29` edges and `2^29` nodes in each
partition. Edge `i` (for `0 ≤ i < 2^29`) connects:

```text
u(i) = siphash-2-4(k0..k3, 2i)     mod 2^29   (partition U)
v(i) = siphash-2-4(k0..k3, 2i + 1) mod 2^29   (partition V)
```

A valid proof is a set of 42 edge indices whose edges form a single cycle of
length 42 in this graph (alternating between partitions, visiting 21 distinct
nodes in each, with no repeated edges).

**Timing target.** The `42-29` parameterization targets roughly 10-15 seconds of
_expected_ (average) solve time on the reference implementation described in
[Implementation guidance](#implementation-guidance), running on commodity server
hardware. This is a target for parameter selection, not a guarantee on
individual attempts: because a randomly seeded graph contains a 42-cycle only
with some probability, realized solve time is stochastic — the prover retries
with new nonces until a solvable graph is found, so any single attempt may
finish well under or well over the target. Verifiers MUST NOT reject a proof for
arriving unusually quickly or slowly; the minting stamp has no timing acceptance
bound. Implementations calibrating a different deployment's expected solve time
MUST NOT do so by changing `edge_bits` without minting a new, explicitly
identified algorithm profile (see
[Compatibility and upgrade classes](#compatibility-and-upgrade-classes)) —
`tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckoo-cycle-42-29-keccak256-cogen` names one fixed
parameterization so that all conforming implementations impose the same cost.

The proof response is:

```json
{
    "algorithm": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckoo-cycle-42-29-keccak256-cogen",
    "nonce": 8137226,
    "solution": [123, 456, 789, "..."]
}
```

(The example `solution` is truncated for illustration.) The `solution` array
MUST contain exactly 42 unsigned integer edge indices in strictly increasing
order (the canonical form of the edge set). Each edge index MUST be less than
`2^29`, and `nonce` MUST be an integer in `[0, 2^64)`. Verification MUST reject
duplicate, unsorted, out-of-range, or non-integer entries before evaluating the
Cuckoo Cycle proof; it then recomputes `S(nonce)`, derives the 84 endpoints of
the 42 supplied edges, and checks that they form a single 42-cycle. The minting
stamp has no receiver-issued challenge and no expiry time; it remains valid for
the committed `(server_name, key_id)` tuple. If either committed value changes,
the origin MUST produce a new proof (a new key body or new `server_name` changes
`cogen_stamp`, which changes `S(nonce)` for every nonce, so a stale proof cannot
be reused). Receivers SHOULD cache successful stamp verification by `key_id`.

##### Key object validation procedure

The checks above are scattered across the preceding prose as individual MUSTs.
This section states them as one ordered procedure. Receiving servers and
notaries MUST validate an advertised `fn-dsa-512:<short_key_id>` key object in
this order, rejecting the entire key at the first failing step and performing no
later step once a step has failed:

1. **Field presence and shape.** The key object MUST contain `key` (a
   well-formed, unpadded base64 FN-DSA-512 public key of the expected length)
   and `pow` (an object containing `algorithm`, `nonce`, and `solution`). A
   missing or structurally malformed field fails validation here.
2. **Algorithm identifier.** `pow.algorithm` MUST exactly equal
   `tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckoo-cycle-42-29-keccak256-cogen`. Any other value
   fails validation here as unrecognized; do not fall back to treating it as the
   old plain-hash construction.
3. **Solution and nonce shape.** `pow.solution` MUST contain exactly 42 unsigned
   integers, each strictly less than `2^29`, in strictly increasing order, with
   no duplicates. `pow.nonce` MUST be an integer in `[0, 2^64)`. Any violation
   fails validation here, before any hashing is performed.
4. **Identity digest recomputation.** Recompute `cogen_stamp` from the enclosing
   response's advertised `key` and `server_name`, then compute
   `S(nonce) = Keccak-256(canonical_json(cogen_stamp) || uint64_le(nonce))`
   using the supplied `nonce`. This step cannot itself fail; it produces the
   value the next two steps check against.
5. **`short_key_id` match.** Compare the enclosing dictionary key's
   `short_key_id` (the string following `fn-dsa-512:`) against the first 20
   base64url characters of `S(nonce)`. A mismatch fails validation here — the
   graph MUST NOT be evaluated.
6. **Cycle verification.** Only if steps 1-5 all passed: derive `k0..k3` from
   `S(nonce)`, compute the 84 SipHash-2-4 endpoints for the 42 supplied edge
   indices, and confirm they form a single cycle of length 42, alternating
   between partitions, visiting 21 distinct nodes in each, with no repeated
   edges. This is the only step that requires evaluating the graph; every
   earlier step exists specifically to let a receiver reject cheaply before
   reaching it.
7. **Self-signature.** Independently of steps 1-6: verify the FN-DSA
   self-signature over the enclosing response, keyed by the same `short_key_id`,
   using the advertised `key` (see the self-signature requirement above). This
   check does not depend on `pow` and MAY be performed before, after, or
   concurrently with steps 1-6, but the key is not valid unless both this step
   and step 6 pass — neither substitutes for the other.

A key object is accepted as PoW-and-signature-valid only if steps 1 through 7
all pass. Passing this procedure makes the key body a _candidate_; it does not
by itself determine whether the candidate is bound as new, promoted from a
provisional binding, or rejected as a collision against a prior observation —
that determination is First Seen Wins as defined in MSC4499, applied only after
this procedure succeeds, and is out of scope for this section.

##### Federation HTTP authentication

Sending servers that support this MSC MUST include the `X-Matrix-PQC` header on
outgoing federation requests when they have a valid FN-DSA server key. Unknown
HTTP headers are ignored by legacy receivers, so no capability discovery is
needed for deployment.

```http
Authorization: X-Matrix origin="example.com",destination="matrix.org",key="ed25519:auto",sig="<base64-ed25519-signature>"
X-Matrix-PQC: origin="example.com",destination="matrix.org",key="fn-dsa-512:<short_key_id>",origin_ts_at="1798847900000",sig="<base64-fn-dsa-signature>"
```

The FN-DSA signature MUST be computed over the same JSON signing object used for
existing Matrix federation request authentication (containing `method`, `uri`,
`origin`, `destination`, and `content` when present), with the additional
signature-covered `origin_ts_at` field from the `X-Matrix-PQC` header. Although
`origin_ts_at` is encoded as a quoted HTTP header parameter, senders and
verifiers MUST parse it as a base-10 integer millisecond timestamp and insert it
into the JSON signing object as a JSON number, not as a JSON string.

`X-Matrix-PQC` uses the same parameter syntax and parsing rules as the existing
`Authorization: X-Matrix` header. Required parameters are `origin`,
`destination`, `key`, `origin_ts_at`, and `sig`. Unknown parameters MUST be
ignored. Duplicate parameters or multiple `X-Matrix-PQC` headers render the PQC
transport authentication invalid. `origin_ts_at` is an integer millisecond
timestamp chosen by the origin and covered by the FN-DSA signature. Header
values for `origin_ts_at` MUST contain only an unsigned base-10 integer
representation. The `sig` parameter value is the unpadded base64-encoded FN-DSA
signature. Malformed headers (invalid base64, missing required parameters, or
unparsable syntax) MUST be treated as absent for enforcement purposes and SHOULD
be logged.

For live requests, receiving servers MUST reject the `X-Matrix-PQC` header for
enforcement purposes if `origin_ts_at` differs from the receiver's local clock
by more than 5 minutes. This bounds replay and makes the signed timestamp
meaningful for key-expiry evaluation; it does not let the origin extend an
expired or closed key's accepted lifetime.

This MSC introduces the header with advisory-but-verified semantics:

- Receiving servers that support this MSC MUST verify the `X-Matrix-PQC` header
  whenever it is present and the sending server has a published FN-DSA key.
- A verification failure SHOULD be logged as a warning but MUST NOT cause
  request rejection, provided the Ed25519 `Authorization` header is valid.
- If a receiving server has already cached an FN-DSA key for the sending server,
  absence of the `X-Matrix-PQC` header on requests from that server SHOULD be
  logged as a potential downgrade indicator.
- Implementations MAY offer an operator-level strict mode that rejects requests
  lacking valid PQC transport authentication from peers with cached FN-DSA keys.
  Strict mode MUST be configurable because legacy servers and advisory-period
  deployments may omit `X-Matrix-PQC` even when the Ed25519 `Authorization`
  header is valid.
- Legacy servers that do not support this MSC ignore the `X-Matrix-PQC` header
  entirely.

Mandatory room-scoped enforcement is defined by MSC 00E2. Optional session
amortization that replaces per-request FN-DSA signatures with a negotiated MAC
is defined by MSC 00E5. The Ed25519 `Authorization` header remains required on
all federation requests as long as any legacy room version exists in the
federation.

##### Detached notary provenance bundles

Notary-specific provenance material MUST be carried outside the origin key
object. A notary MAY retain and redistribute a detached provenance bundle
describing how it observed a key, but such a bundle is never required for the
validity of the underlying key object and MUST NOT be treated as part of the
minting flow.

This preserves a single canonical origin key package signing object: the object
fetched directly from the origin and the object redistributed by a notary remain
equivalent after removing `signatures` and `unsigned` and applying Matrix
Canonical JSON serialization, and therefore hash to the same
`server_key_package_sha256`. A notary response may add its own signatures,
observation records, or references to detached artifacts, so raw wire JSON and
full response objects are not expected to be byte-for-byte identical.

Notary-specific provenance data such as local fetch timestamps, retained TLS
evidence, challenge/proof artifacts from any optional local anti-spam workflow,
and audit notes MUST be carried outside the origin key object, either in
notary-signed observation records or in a separately retained provenance bundle.
They MUST NOT affect the canonical hash or signature input of the origin key
package.

Detached provenance bundles are advisory provenance. A notary MAY retain them,
serve them on demand, or include stable digests of them in a signed observation,
but other receivers MUST NOT reject an otherwise-valid FN-DSA key object solely
because such detached provenance metadata is absent, delayed, too fast, or too
slow.

#### Notary expectations and key validity

Key notaries (`/_matrix/key/v2/query`) MUST include FN-DSA keys and their
corresponding signatures in responses when present on the queried server.
Notaries MUST validate the remote server's FN-DSA self-signature for the queried
`server_name` — and MUST recompute and validate the hash-derived `short_key_id`
against the advertised key body, and MUST verify a valid proof-of-work as
specified in [Key minting Proof-of-Work](#key-minting-proof-of-work) — before
attesting to the key; if any check fails, the notary MUST NOT include that
FN-DSA key in its response. Notary responses are themselves signed objects;
notaries that support this MSC MUST include FN-DSA signatures on their
responses.

Before attesting to an FN-DSA key, a notary MUST also check its retained
observations for the same `(server_name, algorithm, short_key_id)` with a
different `key_id`. If such a conflict is known to that notary, it MUST NOT emit
a normal attestation for the new key body and SHOULD retain or emit advisory
equivocation evidence instead. This check certifies only "no collision known to
this notary at the time of attestation"; it MUST NOT be described as a global
non-collision guarantee.

**Interaction with querying servers.** A suppressed attestation means only that
this specific `key_id` carries no attestation in the response; it MUST NOT be
treated as grounds to reject the response as a whole, and other keys and records
in the same response remain independently valid. A querying server that receives
an accompanying `notary_equivocations` record SHOULD parse and log it to alert
operators to the conflict, rather than treating the missing attestation as an
unremarkable cache miss. Beyond that alerting, the record creates no new
obligation: the querying server proceeds exactly as it would for any other key
this notary could not supply, subject to its own existing fetch and
negative-caching behavior — this MSC does not require an immediate direct fetch
on top of that, since mandating one would hand an attacker a free
network-amplification lever against a dead or unresponsive origin. If no valid
key is ultimately obtained by any means, the dependent signature simply fails
verification, consistent with the advisory-only invariant below: equivocation
evidence informs operators, and never substitutes for, forces, or blocks a
verification outcome.

A notary MUST NOT add, remove, reorder, or rewrite any member of the origin key
object other than adding entries under `signatures`. As a conformance check,
`server_key_package_sha256` recomputed from a notary-redistributed key object
after removing `signatures` and `unsigned` MUST equal the digest recomputed from
a direct origin fetch of the same response snapshot.

##### Notary observations

Notaries MAY include `notary_observations` records describing how they observed
an FN-DSA key. These records are signed provenance metadata: they let operators
and later auditors verify that a named notary claims to have fetched a specific
server key over HTTPS at a specific time and under a specific TLS certificate
context.

Notary observations are strictly advisory. They are not a substitute for Matrix
server-key validation and MUST NOT change acceptance semantics.

```json
{
    "notary_observations": [
        {
            "notary_server_name": "notary.example",
            "observed_server_name": "example.com",
            "observed_at": 1798848000000,
            "fetch_uri": "https://example.com/_matrix/key/v2/server",
            "transport": "https",
            "tls": {
                "leaf_spki_sha256": "<unpadded-base64url-sha256>",

                "tls_13_provenance": {
                    "transcript_hash_algorithm": "sha256",
                    "handshake_transcript_hash": "<unpadded-base64url-hash>",
                    "certificate_verify_signature_scheme": "ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256",
                    "server_certificate_verify_signature": "<unpadded-base64url-signature>"
                }
            },
            "key_id": "<unpadded-base64url-key-id>",
            "server_key_package_sha256": "<unpadded-base64url-sha256>",
            "provenance_bundle_sha256": "<unpadded-base64url-sha256>",
            "valid_until_ts": 1798848000000,
            "signatures": {
                "notary.example": {
                    "ed25519:auto": "<base64-ed25519-signature>",
                    "fn-dsa-512:<short_key_id>": "<base64-fn-dsa-signature>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The observation signature input is the following byte string:

```text
len16("matrix:notary-key-observation:v1") ||
"matrix:notary-key-observation:v1" ||
len16(notary_server_name) ||
notary_server_name ||
len16(observed_server_name) ||
observed_server_name ||
uint64_be(observed_at) ||
len16(fetch_uri) ||

if provenance_bundle_sha256_present:
    len16(provenance_bundle_sha256) ||
    provenance_bundle_sha256 ||
uint64_be(valid_until_ts)
```

Formatting definitions:

- `len16(x)` is the two-byte big-endian length of the UTF-8 byte string `x`,
  followed immediately by `x`.
- `uint64_be(ts)` is an unsigned 64-bit big-endian millisecond timestamp.
- `leaf_spki_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the TLS
  leaf certificate's SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER.
- `leaf_cert_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the
  full TLS leaf certificate DER observed by the notary during its HTTPS fetch.
- `server_key_package_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest
  of the observed origin server-key package's Matrix Canonical JSON
  representation after removing only `signatures` and `unsigned`.
- When `provenance_bundle_sha256` is present, it is the unpadded
  base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of a detached notary provenance bundle
  retained by that notary for this observation. The bundle format is
  notary-defined, but any challenge/proof artifacts, retained transcript
  evidence, or audit notes linked from a signed observation MUST live there
  rather than inside the origin key object.

Notary and verifier constraints:

- A notary MUST NOT emit an observation unless it performed the described fetch
  itself.
- Verifiers MAY validate and store these records for diagnostics, audits, and
  operator review.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST verify the notary's signature
  using the notary's Matrix server signing key.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST check that
  `observed_server_name` matches the queried `server_name`.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST check that `key_id` and
  `valid_until_ts` match the observed key response described by the record.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST check that
  `server_key_package_sha256` matches the observed key response described by the
  record.
- When `provenance_bundle_sha256` is present, a verifier MAY fetch or inspect
  the detached bundle out of band for diagnostics or audit. This reference is
  advisory and MUST NOT change automated key acceptance semantics.

##### TLS 1.3 compact provenance

`tls_13_provenance` MUST be omitted for non-TLS-1.3 fetches. When
`tls_13_provenance` is present, `transport` MUST be `https`, `leaf_spki_sha256`
and `leaf_cert_sha256` MUST be present, and `tls_13_provenance_sha256` is the
unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the following byte string:

```text
len16("matrix:tls13-provenance:v1") ||
"matrix:tls13-provenance:v1" ||
len16(transcript_hash_algorithm) ||
transcript_hash_algorithm ||
len16(handshake_transcript_hash) ||
handshake_transcript_hash ||
len16(certificate_verify_signature_scheme) ||
certificate_verify_signature_scheme ||
len32(server_certificate_verify_signature) ||
server_certificate_verify_signature
```

Formatting definitions:

- `len32(x)` is the four-byte big-endian length of the byte string `x`, followed
  immediately by `x`.
- `handshake_transcript_hash` is the literal cryptographic hash of the TLS 1.3
  Handshake Context up to but excluding the server `CertificateVerify` message,
  as defined by RFC 8446 Section 4.4.1, encoded as unpadded base64url.
- The `handshake_transcript_hash` calculation uses raw TLS Handshake messages
  and excludes TLS record-layer headers.
- `transcript_hash_algorithm` MUST be the hash algorithm of the negotiated TLS
  1.3 cipher suite.
- `certificate_verify_signature_scheme` MUST be a TLS `SignatureScheme` registry
  name.
- `server_certificate_verify_signature` is the literal TLS 1.3
  `CertificateVerify` signature, encoded as unpadded base64url.
- This compact construction intentionally does not carry the full handshake
  transcript.

Validation requirements:

- A verifier or auditor validating compact `tls_13_provenance` MUST obtain a TLS
  leaf certificate matching `leaf_cert_sha256` and `leaf_spki_sha256`, for
  example from Certificate Transparency logs, out-of-band certificate evidence,
  or a retained notary audit bundle.
- The verifier MUST verify `server_certificate_verify_signature` according to
  the TLS 1.3 `CertificateVerify` construction for the server context in RFC
  8446 Section 4.4.3, using the signed content formed from 64 bytes of `0x20`,
  the ASCII context string `TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify`, a single `0x00`
  byte, and the stated `handshake_transcript_hash`.
- Verifiers SHOULD validate that the obtained leaf certificate chains to the
  WebPKI and was valid for `observed_server_name` at `observed_at`, including
  Certificate Transparency evidence where available.

Trust and enforcement boundaries:

- Compact TLS 1.3 provenance proves only that the notary presents evidence that
  the holder of the obtained TLS certificate private key produced a valid
  `CertificateVerify` signature over the stated transcript hash.
- Compact TLS 1.3 provenance does not prove that the TLS evidence was captured
  at `observed_at`; it proves only that the certificate key holder signed the
  stated transcript hash at some time. Freshness beyond the notary's signed
  assertion requires retained transcript evidence or a stronger transcript
  verification system.
- Compact TLS 1.3 provenance does not prove that the HTTP response body was
  faithfully reported by the notary; proving payload fidelity without trusting
  the notary requires a separate TLS transcript-verification system such as
  TLSNotary or DECO.
- Closing this gap by binding the application payload to the TLS session itself
  — an RFC 9266 `tls-exporter` value, an X.509 cross-signature over the Matrix
  key body using the TLS certificate's private key, or a DNS TXT record at the
  domain (DNSSEC-backed or not) — was considered and deliberately excluded from
  this MSC. An exporter binding or an X.509 cross-signature both require the
  Matrix daemon to hold TLS session or private key material it typically does
  not have when deployed behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, HAProxy). A DNS
  TXT record adds no cryptographic assurance beyond the WebPKI validation
  `tls_13_provenance` already provides — an unsigned record is spoofable by the
  same on-path attacker already assumed in this MSC's threat model, and a
  notary-reported TXT observation is exactly as forgeable as any other bare
  notary claim, i.e. it could not be given weight in the corroboration tier
  without recreating the live-oracle problem the `notary_equivocations` design
  avoids. DNSSEC would close the spoofing gap for the TXT approach but is
  unevenly deployed across origin domains, so it cannot serve as a baseline
  mechanism. Closing this class of gap in general requires an MPC-based
  transcript-verification system such as TLSNotary or DECO (see above), which is
  out of scope for this MSC.
- Because the compact form carries only the transcript hash, it does not by
  itself let a later auditor inspect or recompute the handshake transcript,
  confirm the SNI value, confirm detached notary workflow artifacts, or confirm
  other handshake contents.
- A notary that wants independently auditable transcript contents MAY retain or
  publish the full TLS Handshake messages, or equivalent transcript evidence, in
  an out-of-band audit bundle. Such transcript evidence MUST use the same RFC
  8446 Section 4.4.1 Handshake Context definition and MUST exclude TLS
  record-layer headers.
- `tls_13_provenance` remains advisory provenance metadata and MUST NOT affect
  automated key acceptance, event acceptance, or state resolution.
- Non-normatively, compact TLS 1.3 provenance is intended as low-cost forensic
  evidence attached to a signed notary observation. The notary's own signature
  binds the observation timestamp, observed server name, certificate
  fingerprints, key fingerprint, and TLS provenance digest to that notary's
  identity; the TLS evidence then helps distinguish an actual TLS-origin
  observation from a purely invented certificate claim. It is not intended to
  make homeservers parse TLS handshakes, enforce freshness automatically, or
  treat the notary observation as machine-verifiable proof of HTTP payload
  fidelity.

FN-DSA keys follow identical validity semantics to Ed25519 keys: a signature
made by `fn-dsa-512:<short_key_id>` is valid if the key was valid at the time of
the signed operation. Retired FN-DSA keys appear in `old_verify_keys` with an
`expired_ts`. The `valid_until_ts` field governs cache lifetime for the entire
key response, identically to existing behavior.

##### Notary equivocation evidence

When a notary observes conflicting FN-DSA key material for the same
`(server_name, algorithm, short_key_id)` with a different `key_id` (see
[Notary expectations and key validity](#notary-expectations-and-key-validity)),
it SHOULD retain or emit a `notary_equivocations` record documenting the
conflict, alongside `server_keys` and `notary_observations` in
`/_matrix/key/v2/query` responses, and in the body of a `409 M_CONFLICT`
response body or in any detached provenance artifact the notary serves.

`M_CONFLICT` is introduced by this MSC for this use case. A `409 M_CONFLICT`
response means the notary or receiver has already observed a different
minting-valid FN-DSA key body for the same
`(server_name, algorithm, short_key_id)` tuple and is refusing to treat the new
body as an acceptable binding for that tuple. The response SHOULD include
`notary_equivocations` records when the responder has signed evidence it is
willing to disclose.

A bare record is only a notary's claim that it observed both key bodies — any
consumer must trust the notary to believe it. But because each conflicting
`/_matrix/key/v2/server` response is itself self-signed by the origin, two such
responses for the same key ID constitute a self-contained, non-repudiable proof
of equivocation, verifiable by any third party without trusting the notary at
all — the same role a certificate-transparency misissuance proof or a
proof-of-stake slashing proof plays in other systems. `notary_equivocations` is
therefore an attestation by default, with an optional embedded-proof upgrade:

```json
{
    "notary_equivocations": [
        {
            "record_version": 1,
            "observed_server_name": "example.com",

            },
            "conflicting": {
                "key_id": "<unpadded-base64url-key-id>",
                "server_key_package_sha256": "<unpadded-base64url-sha256>",
                "first_observed_ts": 1798848600000,
                "observed_via": "notary"
            },
            "first_response": { "...": "optional, full origin key response" },
            "conflicting_response": {
                "...": "optional, full origin key response"
            },
            "notary_server_name": "notary.example",
            "signatures": {
                "notary.example": {
                    "ed25519:auto": "<base64-ed25519-signature>",
                    "fn-dsa-512:<short_key_id>": "<base64-fn-dsa-signature>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Field semantics:

- `record_version` is `1` for this shape.
- `observed_server_name`, `algorithm`, and `short_key_id` identify the
  equivocating origin and the colliding key family.
- `first` and `conflicting` are each an observation of one of the two
  conflicting key bodies. Despite the naming, the pair is unordered for dedup
  purposes (see below); `first` denotes whichever observation this notary
  learned of earlier, per its own `first_observed_ts`.
- `key_id` in each observation is the unpadded base64url-encoded full key
  identifier for that key body, derived as specified in
  [Key minting Proof-of-Work](#key-minting-proof-of-work).
- `server_key_package_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest
  of that observation's origin `/_matrix/key/v2/server` response, after Matrix
  Canonical JSON serialization with `signatures` and `unsigned` removed,
  identical in construction to the field of the same name in
  [Notary observations](#notary-observations).
- `first_observed_ts` is this notary's own local timestamp of first observing
  that key body under this identity tuple. It establishes ordering only; it is
  not carried forward from any other server's notion of time.
- `observed_via` is `direct` if the notary itself fetched that key body directly
  from the origin over `/_matrix/key/v2/server`, or `notary` if it learned that
  key body via another notary or via federation gossip. This matters for
  provenance: two conflicting `direct` observations are the strongest possible
  signal (the origin genuinely equivocated, or was compromised twice), whereas a
  `notary`-sourced observation may instead reflect a poisoned upstream notary
  rather than origin misbehavior. Consumers of a record MUST take `observed_via`
  into account when judging its strength and MUST NOT treat a `notary`-sourced
  observation as equivalent evidence to a `direct` one.
- `first_response` and `conflicting_response` are OPTIONAL full origin
  `/_matrix/key/v2/server` response bodies for the corresponding observation,
  present only when the notary chooses to embed the proof upgrade (see below).
  When present, each MUST be the exact response the digest in the sibling
  `server_key_package_sha256` was computed from.
- One entry appearing only in `old_verify_keys` (rather than `verify_keys`) is
  attested by the origin's _current_ signing key at the time of that response,
  not by the retired key itself. The embedded response is still origin-signed
  and still constitutes proof of equivocation, but verifiers should note this
  proves "the origin's current key vouched for this historical binding," a
  marginally weaker statement than a live self-signature by the historical key.

The embedded-proof upgrade: a notary MAY include `first_response` and
`conflicting_response` to let any third party verify the equivocation without
trusting the notary, by checking each embedded response's own self-signature
against the key body it contains — no external material is needed. Because each
embedded response is a few KB, a single `/_matrix/key/v2/query` response or
`409 M_CONFLICT` body MUST NOT include more than 10 records carrying embedded
responses; any additional qualifying records in that same response MUST omit
`first_response` and `conflicting_response` and carry only the hash-referenced
attestation fields.

Signing and identity:

- Each record is signed individually by the notary, not the enclosing array, so
  that a record survives being relayed, cached, or re-served individually by
  downstream tooling without losing its own attestation.
- The signature input is the following byte string, computed over the record
  with `signatures` (and, when present, `first_response`/`conflicting_response`)
  excluded:

```text
len16("matrix:notary-equivocation:v1") ||
"matrix:notary-equivocation:v1" ||
uint8(record_version) ||
len16(notary_server_name) ||
notary_server_name ||
len16(observed_server_name) ||
observed_server_name ||
len16(algorithm) ||
algorithm ||
len16(short_key_id) ||
short_key_id ||
len16(first.key_id) ||

conflicting.server_key_package_sha256 ||
uint64_be(conflicting.first_observed_ts) ||
len16(conflicting.observed_via) ||
conflicting.observed_via
```

`len16`, `uint8`, and `uint64_be` are as defined in
[Notary observations](#notary-observations). Embedded full responses, when
present, are not covered by this signature input; their integrity is instead
verified independently via each embedded response's own self-signature, matched
against `server_key_package_sha256`.

- Dedup identity: a record is identified by the tuple
  `(observed_server_name, algorithm, short_key_id, first.key_id, conflicting.key_id)`,
  with the `key_id` pair treated as unordered. A notary MUST NOT emit more than
  one record for the same identity within a single response; consumers
  aggregating records from multiple sources or over time MUST deduplicate on
  this identity.
- Retention: notaries SHOULD retain equivocation records at least as long as
  either of the involved key bindings remains retained locally. This MSC does
  not define any further retention mandate, reputation semantics, or gossip
  protocol for these records.

Verifier constraints:

- A verifier MUST validate the notary's signature over the record using the
  notary's Matrix server signing key before trusting the attestation.
- A verifier validating an embedded-proof record MUST independently verify each
  of `first_response` and `conflicting_response` against its own self-signature
  and MUST check that each hashes (after Canonical JSON serialization with
  `signatures` and `unsigned` removed) to the corresponding
  `server_key_package_sha256`. A record whose embedded responses fail this check
  MUST be treated as an unverified attestation, not as a proof, regardless of
  the notary's own signature over the record.

**The advisory-only invariant.** Equivocation evidence — whether a bare
attestation or a fully embedded, independently verified proof — is advisory
forensic material only. MSC4499 already establishes that room ACLs and other
federation-visible mechanisms MUST NOT force eviction of a cached key binding or
bypass its First Seen Wins rule; `notary_equivocations` records are exactly such
a federation-visible mechanism, so the same constraint applies to them by
construction. A receiving server MUST NOT allow a `notary_equivocations` record,
of any strength, to automatically trigger key-binding eviction, rebinding,
re-verification rollback, or any other deviation from First Seen Wins. Without
this constraint, an equivocation record — forged or genuine — mailed to every
peer would become precisely the federated eviction-forcing vector that MSC4499's
permanent-binding rule was designed to close. Equivocation evidence may inform a
human operator deciding whether to use the manual cache-eviction mechanism; it
MUST NOT, by itself, inform the cache.

##### Self-signed expiry claim carriage

Notaries MAY include valid `m.server_key.expiry.v1` expiry claims observed from
the origin or from federation gossip in a top-level `expiry_claims` array
alongside `server_keys` and `notary_observations` in `/_matrix/key/v2/query`
responses. During the unstable period, the claim type is
`tk.nutra.msc45xx.server_key.expiry.v1`. A notary MUST verify the claim's
signatures, `server_name`, and `key_id` binding before redistributing it. A
notary that has observed a valid expiry claim for a key it returns MUST include
that claim. Notary redistribution does not make the claim notary specific:
receivers continue to authenticate the claim by its own signatures and use the
smallest observed `not_valid_after_ts` for the closed key as specified by this
MSC family. If an enclosing `old_verify_keys` wrapper carries a later
`expired_ts` for the same key, the earlier self-signed expiry claim wins.

Any third-party attestation metadata a server or notary chooses to additionally
track (e.g. historic corroboration records, reputation signals) is advisory
only. Servers MUST NOT reject events, keys, or state based solely on missing,
false, suspicious, flimsy, or otherwise invalid attestation metadata. Such
metadata MUST NOT affect automated verification, acceptance, or state
resolution. If it is to influence behavior at all, that MUST occur only through
explicit admin override or manual operator intervention. Automated state
resolution MUST continue to operate normally, remain backwards compatible with
legacy federation traffic, and converge according to the established network
rules.

Because a server's very first FN-DSA key observation is TOFU and authenticates
only via the existing Ed25519 trust model and MSC4499 First Seen Wins semantics,
it is vulnerable to an attacker positioned on that specific fetch path — a
targeted, localized man-in-the-middle rather than a global compromise.
Implementations MUST NOT treat contradictory notary observations, by themselves,
as sufficient to reject or invalidate an otherwise valid first observation:
doing so would let any false, compromised, or stale notary create a
denial-of-service condition against legitimate bootstrap. This MSC therefore
leaves first-observation acceptance semantics aligned with the existing Matrix
server-key trust model and MSC4499; it does not define any cross-source
consensus or conflict-resolution mechanism for FN-DSA bootstrap.
