# MSC00E4: Post-quantum server keys and minting

This draft contains notary observations, detached notary provenance bundles, and
TLS 1.3 compact provenance material split from the archived 00E1 draft, plus the
[profile-bound key minting](#canonical-key-object) mechanism. The version of
that mechanism here supersedes the plain SHA-256 key identifier construction
still on record in the now-frozen 00E1 draft: this file is normative for FN-DSA
key minting and observation going forward.

## Algorithm profile (`fndsa512`)

This section defines the only key-minting profile currently registered by this
MSC. It supersedes the legacy construction retained later in this document for
historical context; the legacy construction is non-normative and MUST NOT be
accepted by implementations of this profile.

The profile token is the opaque string `tk.nutra.msc45xx.serverkey.v1`.
Implementations MUST compare it by exact string equality against a closed
registry. They MUST NOT parse it to recover algorithm parameters. The registry
entry fixes FN-DSA-512, SHA3-256, Matrix Canonical JSON, Cuckatoo
`edge_bits = 29`, `proof_size = 42`, the short-ID encoding, and the action tags
below.

### Canonical key object

The normative shape is:

```json
{
  "server_name": "nutra.tk",
  "valid_until_ts": 1815632341240,
  "verify_keys": {
    "fndsa512:9f3c1ade47b0c2915e6d8a3f10bb47d2": {
      "key": "<unpadded-base64-fn-dsa-512-public-key>",
      "profile": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.serverkey.v1",
      "pow": {
        "nonce": 110,
        "solution": [15721871, 27250623, "...", 517987691]
      }
    }
  },
  "signatures": {
    "nutra.tk": {
      "fndsa512:9f3c1ade47b0c2915e6d8a3f10bb47d2": "<signature>"
    }
  }
}
```

`trusted_notary_keys`, `claims`, `fips_206_revision`, `pow.algorithm`, and empty
optional containers are not part of this profile. Empty optional containers MUST
be omitted. Every field inside a `verify_keys` entry is either fixed by the
profile or committed by the key ID preimage; therefore one key name identifies
one key entry.

The key name uses unpadded base64url encoding and the fixed algorithm token
`fndsa512`. The short ID is the unpadded RFC 4648 §5 URL-safe base64 encoding of
the first 16 bytes (128 bits) of the recomputed SHA3-256 key ID. Key names are
compared by exact string equality and MUST NOT be base64-decoded during
verification.

### Bound preimages

Let `N` be an integer with `0 <= N < 2^32`, `P` the exact profile token, `S` the
server name, and `K` the decoded public-key bytes. `base64_unpadded(K)` is the
canonical public-key string in the object. The graph seed is:

$$
G = \operatorname{SHA3\text{-}256}(\operatorname{canonical\_json}({
  "action": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.serverkey.v1.graph",
  "nonce": N,
  "profile": P,
  "public_key": \operatorname{base64\_unpadded}(K),
  "server_name": S
}))
$$

The 32 bytes of `G` are interpreted as four little-endian unsigned 64-bit words
`k0`, `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`, in that order. These four words are loaded directly
as the internal SipHash-2-4 state words `v0`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`; the standard
SipHash key-initialisation constants are NOT applied (this matches John Tromp's
256-bit-keyed Cuckatoo SipHash construction).

For edge index `i` (`0 ≤ i < 2^29`), compute 64-bit unsigned integers `2*i` and
`2*i+1`. Passing `2*i` and `2*i+1` (each encoded as an 8-byte unsigned
little-endian integer) into this 256-bit-state SipHash-2-4 function produces the
64-bit outputs; masking each output with `(2^29 - 1)` yields the partition
endpoints `U` and `V` respectively.

_Test vector:_ For graph seed
`G = 000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f` and edge
index `i = 0`:

- Endpoint `U` (`2*0 = 0`) masked to 29 bits = `6597635` (`0x0064ac03`)
- Endpoint `V` (`2*0+1 = 1`) masked to 29 bits = `142045839` (`0x0877728f`)

These action tags, widths, and masking rules are normative; implementations MUST
NOT use the legacy SHA-256 graph function.

The key ID is:

$$
I = \operatorname{SHA3\text{-}256}(\operatorname{canonical\_json}({
  "action": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.serverkey.v1.keyid",
  "nonce": N,
  "profile": P,
  "public_key": \operatorname{base64\_unpadded}(K),
  "server_name": S,
  "solution": [e_0,\ldots,e_{41}]
}))
$$

The solution is exactly 42 strictly ascending edge indices, each less than
`2^29`. The profile registry defines the short-ID truncation and encoding. There
is no separately serialized full key ID, algorithm parameter string, or nonce
suffix.

### Verification

A verifier MUST reject at the first failed step and MUST perform these checks in
order:

1. Match `profile` exactly against the closed registry.
2. Decode `key` and require exactly the registry's public-key length.
3. Require exactly 42 unsigned solution entries, strictly ascending, with each
   entry less than `2^29`; require `nonce < 2^32`.
4. Compute `G`, interpret its 32 bytes as four unsigned 64-bit little-endian
   words `(k0, k1, k2, k3)` for SipHash-2-4, derive bipartite graph endpoints
   $u_j = \operatorname{SipHash-2-4}(2 \cdot e_j) \mathbin{\&} (2^{29} - 1)$ in
   partition U and
   $v_j = \operatorname{SipHash-2-4}(2 \cdot e_j + 1) \mathbin{\&} (2^{29} - 1)$
   in partition V for each edge index $e_j \in [e_0, \ldots, e_{41}]$ (with
   $2 \cdot e_j$ and $2 \cdot e_j + 1$ encoded as 64-bit unsigned little-endian
   integers), and verify that the 42 edges form a valid closed 42-cycle in the
   graph with no repeated vertices per partition.
5. Compute `I` and require the map key to equal `fndsa512:` followed by the
   registry-defined short form of `I`.
6. Require the top-level `server_name` to be the name used in the preimages and
   verify `signatures[server_name][key_name]` over the canonical signing bytes.

The proof is a co-generation stamp, not proof of private-key possession. The
self-signature supplies possession; both checks are mandatory. FN-DSA signatures
MUST have the exact registry-defined length and any fixed-length padding bytes
MUST be zero; nonzero padding is invalid.

Implementations MUST reject duplicate, unsorted, out-of-range, non-integer, or
non-canonical proof values before graph evaluation. A valid proof may expose a
small number of additional valid cycles. The security property is that a key ID
cannot be exhibited without a valid proof, and the expected number of key IDs
per solved graph is `1 + O(1/42)`; strict one-proof-per-key-ID is not claimed.

There is no deployed v0 compatibility path. A change to the profile, graph
parameters, hash, canonicalization, action tags, or key-ID encoding MUST use a
new opaque profile token and a separately registered profile.

The remaining algorithm and key-generation text below is retained only as
historical background. Where it conflicts with `tk.nutra.msc45xx.serverkey.v1`,
the profile, preimages, object shape, and validation procedure above control.

### FN-DSA implementation background

This MSC defines `fn-dsa-512` as the post-quantum server signing algorithm for
Matrix federation. It targets FN-DSA-512 (`n=512`, `q=12289`) as specified by
the NIST FIPS 206 draft revision identified by the key object's
`fips_206_revision` metadata. Until FIPS 206 is finalized, deployments MUST use
the unstable identifier `tk.nutra.msc45xx.fn-dsa-512` in protocol fields.

FN-DSA-512 has 897-byte public keys and 666-byte raw signatures. Standard Matrix
base64 encoding expands a 666-byte signature to 888 base64 characters without
padding.

**Public key encoding.** The public key is the raw FN-DSA-512 public key byte
string as defined by FIPS 206. It is encoded as unpadded standard base64 using
the standard RFC 4648 §4 alphabet.

**Signature encoding.** The signature is the raw FN-DSA-512 signature byte
string as defined by FIPS 206. Unlike the original Falcon submission, which used
variable-length signatures, FIPS 206 mandates a fixed-length encoding padded
with zeros. For FN-DSA-512, the raw signature is exactly 666 bytes.
Implementations MUST reject signatures of any other length. Signatures are
encoded as unpadded standard base64 using the standard RFC 4648 §4 alphabet.

**Signing operation.** Unless a more specific Matrix object definition says
otherwise, the message signed is the UTF-8 byte sequence of the Matrix Canonical
JSON representation of the object after removing `signatures` and `unsigned`,
consistent with existing Matrix signing conventions. FN-DSA is invoked in pure
(non-prehash) mode with an empty context string. Implementations MUST reject
non-canonical public key and signature encodings.

For general or un-profiled FN-DSA key objects, metadata like `fips_206_revision`
or `claims` MAY be present. However, under the production profile
`tk.nutra.msc45xx.serverkey.v1`, `claims`, `fips_206_revision`, and
`pow.algorithm` MUST NOT be present in the wire key object, as all algorithm and
implementation parameters are strictly fixed by the profile token.

Servers MUST rotate an FN-DSA server key if a later FIPS 206 draft or final
standard changes the public key encoding, signature encoding, or signing
semantics used by that key. The old key MUST move to `old_verify_keys` with an
appropriate `expired_ts`, and the replacement key MUST be minted under the new
algorithm/profile identifier required by the follow-up MSC or compatibility
class.

### Implementation guidance

Implementations MUST generate FN-DSA keys, perform discrete Gaussian sampling,
and produce FN-DSA signatures using side-channel-resistant, constant-time
techniques. Implementations MUST NOT publish production FN-DSA keys generated by
variable-time, unaudited, or non-conformant FN-DSA implementations. Key
generation and signing are the high-risk operations; verification involves no
secret data and carries no constant-time requirement.

Implementations SHOULD coalesce around a small set of audited libraries that
track the exact FIPS 206 revision used by this MSC. Different libraries may
interoperate only when they implement the same FIPS 206 revision, encodings, and
signing operation. Subtle differences in encoding or signature mode can cause
network divergence.

Implementations SHOULD generate FN-DSA server keys from cryptographically secure
system entropy. Implementations MUST support encrypting FN-DSA private key
material immediately after generation and before displaying, logging, or writing
any export artifact. Whether a given deployment actually supplies a passphrase
and enables this protection is a local operator decision; this MSC requires only
that the capability be present in conformant implementations, not that operators
use it. Human passphrases SHOULD protect stored key material, not directly
derive server identity keys. Password-protected keystores SHOULD use a
memory-hard KDF such as Argon2id to derive the wrapping key from a fresh random
salt, and MUST encrypt private key material with an AEAD construction such as
XChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-GCM using a fresh random nonce. The encrypted private
key export is operator-local secret material: it MUST NOT appear in
`/_matrix/key/v2/server`, notary responses, signed observation records, or any
canonical server-key package hash.

The AEAD additional authenticated data (AAD) SHOULD bind the encrypted private
key to its intended server-key context. The AAD SHOULD include at least the
`server_name`, key algorithm, `key_id` or full key name, public key, FIPS 206
revision, and keystore format version. This binding does not protect against an
attacker who has both the passphrase and arbitrary code execution, but it
prevents accidental key-file substitution and confused-deputy loading by honest
software.

Deterministic FN-DSA key generation MAY be offered as an explicit recovery or
testing feature only when driven by high-entropy seed material and a persisted
random salt. Implementations SHOULD NOT derive server identity keys directly
from low-entropy human passwords. Deterministic generation policy is local
operator behavior and is not externally verifiable by this protocol.

### Compatibility and upgrade classes

Future changes to this mechanism MUST use the narrowest compatible rollout class
that preserves verifier safety:

- **Patch changes** add optional metadata or clarify validation without changing
  key ID derivation, signature inputs, encodings, or required verification
  behavior. Patch fields MUST be safely ignored by implementations that do not
  understand them.
- **Minor changes** add a compatible extension that requires explicit support by
  both peers, while preserving the baseline behavior in this MSC. Examples
  include a new proof-of-work profile, a new metadata commitment format, or an
  optional session-authentication variant. Minor extensions MUST use distinct
  identifiers and MUST fall back to the mandatory baseline when unsupported.
- **Major changes** alter cryptographic interpretation or break existing
  verification. Examples include changing FN-DSA encodings, signature sizes,
  signing inputs, key ID derivation, or mandatory verification rules. Major
  changes MUST use a new algorithm or profile identifier, publish separate keys
  during migration, and rely on a follow-up MSC or room version before becoming
  mandatory.

## Legacy key minting construction (non-normative)

Homeservers and notaries that support this MSC MUST require a valid
co-generation proof-of-work for every newly generated FN-DSA key body — the
initial minting of a server's first FN-DSA key and every subsequent key-body
rotation — before accepting or attesting to that key. This requirement is
unconditional: there is no exemption for TOFU, notary-sourced, or
otherwise-trusted key objects, and no implementation-level opt-out. A receiving
server or notary MUST reject an FN-DSA key object that lacks a valid embedded
`pow` proof conforming to this section, regardless of whether the accompanying
Ed25519/notary authentication is otherwise valid.

The proof is a non-interactive, cacheable stamp produced by the origin. It is
not issued separately by each receiver. The proof MUST be carried inside the
corresponding FN-DSA key object as the `pow` field. This placement is part of
the Matrix signing object, so the stamp is covered by the origin's server-key
signatures, included in `server_key_package_sha256`, and preserved by notary
redistribution without special handling.

### Trusted notary historical keys

An origin MAY include a top-level `trusted_notary_keys` array in its
`/_matrix/key/v2/server` response. Each entry is a full content-addressed FN-DSA
server-key identifier of the form `fndsa512:<short_key_id>`, where
`<short_key_id>` is the registry-defined 22-character unpadded base64url
encoding of the first 16 bytes of the SHA3-256 `key_id` defined in this MSC. The
field is part of the Matrix signing object and therefore covered by the origin's
server-key signatures. If present but empty, it explicitly authorizes no
notary-supplied historical keys.

`trusted_notary_keys` lets the origin extend its own signed publication without
embedding every historical key body in `old_verify_keys`. A listed identifier is
only a compact pointer: verifiers still need the full historical key object from
their own cache, a notary cache, federation gossip, or some other retained
archive before they can verify a signature made by that key. Because each listed
identifier is content-addressed, a notary cannot fabricate a different FN-DSA
key body to match it. Verifiers recompute the minting-bound `key_id` from the
returned key body and proof, and the value MUST equal the listed full
identifier. A verifier MUST NOT accept a notary-supplied historical key merely
because its short key ID matches an allow-list entry.

A notary returning a key because of `trusted_notary_keys` MUST return the full
key object it retained, including the original `pow` field and any applicable
retirement metadata or expiry claim. Receiving servers MUST validate the
returned key object exactly as they validate a key from `verify_keys` or
`old_verify_keys`: recompute the content-addressed `key_id`, verify the
proof-of-work, check any signatures or expiry claims required for that object
shape, and apply the First Seen Wins binding rules from MSC4499.
`trusted_notary_keys` is not a notary attestation and does not relax collision
handling; it only lets the origin name additional historical keys by content
address without embedding all of their key material in every server-key
response.

**A valid `pow` does not, by itself, prove private-key possession.** The graph
seed and every input to it — the public key body, `server_name`, and the nonce —
are public values; anyone who has observed a public key (their own, or one
copied from another server's response) can mint a valid co-generation proof for
it. The proof's only job is to rate-limit and anti-spam-gate key minting and
rotation; it is not an identity credential. Possession of the FN-DSA private key
is established exclusively by the FN-DSA self-signature: once a server publishes
an FN-DSA key, its `/_matrix/key/v2/server` response MUST include an FN-DSA
self-signature in the `signatures` field, keyed by that key's `short_key_id`,
alongside the existing Ed25519 signature. Receiving servers and notaries MUST
verify this self-signature before trusting the FN-DSA key, independently of and
in addition to verifying `pow`. Both checks are mandatory and neither
substitutes for the other: a syntactically valid `pow` on a key the origin does
not hold the private key for MUST still be rejected, because the response cannot
carry a valid FN-DSA self-signature without the private key, and a validly
self-signed key without a valid `pow` MUST still be rejected per the requirement
above.

Unlike a plain hash of the public key, the key's identifier here is
proof-of-work-bound. The Cuckoo graph is selected from the key body,
`server_name`, and nonce. The final `key_id` is the SHA3-256 digest of the
canonical minting object, which includes the key body, server name, proof
algorithm, nonce, and validated proof solution. This forces key minting and
proof-of-work to happen together: an attacker cannot cheaply scan nonces for a
favorable `short_key_id` before solving the graph, because the final identifier
is unknown until the proof solution is known.

**Key ID derivation.**

```text
minting_object = {
    "action": "fn-dsa-minting-object",
    "algorithm": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckatoo-42-29-sha3-256-cogen",
    "nonce": nonce,
    "public_key": "<unpadded-base64-fn-dsa-512-pubkey>",
    "server_name": "example.com",
    "solution": [solution[0], ..., solution[41]]
}

key_id = SHA3-256(canonical_json(minting_object))
```

where `canonical_json` is Matrix Canonical JSON serialization, `solution` is the
strictly increasing 42-edge proof solution carried in the `pow` object, and
`nonce` is the prover-chosen integer (`0 ≤ nonce < 2^64`). The canonical minting
object is reconstructed by the verifier from the enclosing key object and the
validated `pow` fields; it is not transmitted as a separate object and does not
include `short_key_id`, signatures, `valid_until_ts`, `claims`, notary metadata,
or unknown future extension fields. `key_id` — the identity digest used
throughout this MSC family to name a specific key body — is the SHA3-256 digest
of this canonical minting object, not a plain hash of the public key and not the
pre-solve Cuckatoo graph selector. `short_key_id` is the 22-character unpadded
base64url encoding of the first 16 bytes (128 bits) of `key_id`; it is not a
separate digest. `key_id` is a SHA3-256 output under this proof class, not a
plain SHA-256 output — the two are distinct algorithms despite the similar name.

The 22-character `short_key_id` is a 128-bit prefix. This is not relied on as a
standalone anti-grinding control: an attacker choosing public keys and nonces
can still search for favorable prefixes, but the prefix is not known until a
valid 42-cycle solution has been found and committed into `key_id`. Receivers
rely on the combination of minting cost, full `key_id` validation, and MSC4499
First Seen Wins binding rather than trial-verifying colliding `short_key_id`
candidates.

```json
{
  "fndsa512:<short_key_id>": {
    "key": "<unpadded-base64-fn-dsa-512-pubkey>",
    "pow": {
      "algorithm": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckatoo-42-29-sha3-256-cogen",
      "nonce": 110,
      "solution": [123, 456, 789, "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

The verifier derives the Cuckoo graph from the advertised public key,
`server_name`, and supplied `nonce`; verifies the Cuckoo Cycle solution against
that graph; then computes `key_id` from the canonical minting object. The
enclosing key's advertised `short_key_id` MUST equal the 22-character unpadded
base64url encoding of the first 16 bytes of that final `key_id`.

### Graph derivation

A given graph contains a 42-cycle only with some probability, so the prover
iterates the nonce until the resulting graph is solvable. For each nonce,
compute:

```text
SHA3-256(
    canonical_json({
        "action": "fn-dsa-key-graph",
        "public_key": "<unpadded-base64-fn-dsa-512-pubkey>",
        "server_name": "example.com"
    }) || uint64_le(nonce)
)
```

The resulting 32 bytes are interpreted directly as four little-endian 64-bit
words `k0..k3` forming the SipHash-2-4 key. The bipartite graph has `2^29` edges
and `2^29` nodes in each partition. Edge `i` (for `0 ≤ i < 2^29`) connects:

```text
u(i) = siphash-2-4(k0..k3, 2i)     & (2^29 - 1)   (partition U)
v(i) = siphash-2-4(k0..k3, 2i + 1) & (2^29 - 1)   (partition V)
```

A valid proof is a set of 42 edge indices whose edges form a single cycle of
length 42 in this graph (alternating between partitions, visiting 21 distinct
nodes in each, with no repeated edges).

**Timing target.** The `42-29` parameterization targets roughly 10-15 seconds of
_expected_ (average) solve time on the reference implementation described in
[Implementation guidance](#implementation-guidance), running on commodity server
hardware. This is a target for parameter selection, not a guarantee on
individual attempts: because a randomly seeded graph contains a 42-cycle only
with some probability, realized solve time is stochastic — the prover retries
with new nonces until a solvable graph is found, so any single attempt may
finish well under or well over the target. Verifiers MUST NOT reject a proof for
arriving unusually quickly or slowly; the minting stamp has no timing acceptance
bound. Implementations calibrating a different deployment's expected solve time
MUST NOT do so by changing `edge_bits` without minting a new, explicitly
identified algorithm profile (see
[Compatibility and upgrade classes](#compatibility-and-upgrade-classes)) —
`tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckatoo-42-29-sha3-256-cogen` names one fixed
parameterization so that all conforming implementations impose the same cost.

The proof response is:

```json
{
  "algorithm": "tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckatoo-42-29-sha3-256-cogen",
  "nonce": 110,
  "solution": [123, 456, 789, "..."]
}
```

(The example `solution` is truncated for illustration.) The `solution` array
MUST contain exactly 42 unsigned integer edge indices in strictly increasing
order (the canonical form of the edge set). Each edge index MUST be less than
`2^29`, and `nonce` MUST be an integer in `[0, 2^64)`. Verification MUST reject
duplicate, unsorted, out-of-range, or non-integer entries before evaluating the
Cuckoo Cycle proof; it then recomputes the Cuckoo graph for the supplied nonce,
derives the 84 endpoints of the 42 supplied edges, and checks that they form a
single 42-cycle. Only after the solution verifies does the verifier compute
`key_id` from the canonical minting object. The minting stamp has no
receiver-issued challenge and no expiry time; it remains valid for the committed
`(server_name, key_id)` tuple. If either committed value changes, the origin
MUST produce a new proof (a new key body or new `server_name` selects different
Cuckoo graphs for every nonce, and a different solution changes the canonical
minting object and therefore `key_id`, so a stale proof cannot be reused).
Receivers SHOULD cache successful stamp verification by `key_id`.

### Key object validation procedure

The checks above are scattered across the preceding prose as individual MUSTs.
This section states them as one ordered procedure. Receiving servers and
notaries MUST validate an advertised `fndsa512:<short_key_id>` key object in
this order, rejecting the entire key at the first failing step and performing no
later step once a step has failed:

1. **Field presence and shape.** The key object MUST contain `key` (a
   well-formed, unpadded base64 FN-DSA-512 public key of the expected length)
   and `pow` (an object containing `algorithm`, `nonce`, and `solution`). A
   missing or structurally malformed field fails validation here.
2. **Algorithm identifier.** `pow.algorithm` MUST exactly equal
   `tk.nutra.msc45xx.pow.cuckatoo-42-29-sha3-256-cogen`. Any other value fails
   validation here as unrecognized; do not fall back to treating it as the old
   plain-hash construction.
3. **Solution and nonce shape.** `pow.solution` MUST contain exactly 42 unsigned
   integers, each strictly less than `2^29`, in strictly increasing order, with
   no duplicates. `pow.nonce` MUST be an integer in `[0, 2^64)`. Any violation
   fails validation here, before any hashing is performed.
4. **Cuckoo graph selection.** From the enclosing response's advertised `key`
   and `server_name`, plus the supplied `nonce`, compute the 32-byte value
   specified in [Graph derivation](#graph-derivation). This step cannot itself
   fail; it selects the graph used by the proof.
5. **Cycle verification.** Derive `k0..k3` from that 32-byte value, compute the
   84 SipHash-2-4 endpoints for the 42 supplied edge indices, and confirm they
   form a single cycle of length 42, alternating between partitions, visiting 21
   distinct nodes in each, with no repeated edges. This is the only step that
   requires evaluating the graph; every earlier step exists specifically to let
   a receiver reject cheaply before reaching it.
6. **`short_key_id` match.** Compute `key_id` from the canonical minting object,
   then compare the enclosing dictionary key's `short_key_id` (the string
   following `fndsa512:`) against the 22-character unpadded base64url encoding
   of the first 16 bytes of that `key_id`. A mismatch fails validation here.
7. **Self-signature.** Independently of steps 1-6: verify the FN-DSA
   self-signature over the enclosing response, keyed by the same `short_key_id`,
   using the advertised `key` (see the self-signature requirement above). This
   check does not depend on `pow` and MAY be performed before, after, or
   concurrently with steps 1-6, but the key is not valid unless both this step
   and step 6 pass — neither substitutes for the other.

A key object is accepted as PoW-and-signature-valid only if steps 1 through 7
all pass. Passing this procedure makes the key body a _candidate_; it does not
by itself determine whether the candidate is bound as new, promoted from a
provisional binding, or rejected as a collision against a prior observation —
that determination is First Seen Wins as defined in MSC4499, applied only after
this procedure succeeds, and is out of scope for this section.

## Federation HTTP authentication

Sending servers that support this MSC MUST include the `X-Matrix-PQC` header on
outgoing federation requests when they have a valid FN-DSA server key. Unknown
HTTP headers are ignored by legacy receivers, so no capability discovery is
needed for deployment.

```http
Authorization: X-Matrix origin="example.com",destination="matrix.org",key="ed25519:auto",sig="<base64-ed25519-signature>"
X-Matrix-PQC: origin="example.com",destination="matrix.org",key="fndsa512:<short_key_id>",origin_ts_at="1798847900000",sig="<base64-fn-dsa-signature>"
```

The FN-DSA signature MUST be computed over the same JSON signing object used for
existing Matrix federation request authentication (containing `method`, `uri`,
`origin`, `destination`, and `content` when present), with the additional
signature-covered `origin_ts_at` field from the `X-Matrix-PQC` header. Although
`origin_ts_at` is encoded as a quoted HTTP header parameter, senders and
verifiers MUST parse it as a base-10 integer millisecond timestamp and insert it
into the JSON signing object as a JSON number, not as a JSON string.

`X-Matrix-PQC` uses the same parameter syntax and parsing rules as the existing
`Authorization: X-Matrix` header. Required parameters are `origin`,
`destination`, `key`, `origin_ts_at`, and `sig`. Unknown parameters MUST be
ignored. Duplicate parameters or multiple `X-Matrix-PQC` headers render the PQC
transport authentication invalid. `origin_ts_at` is an integer millisecond
timestamp chosen by the origin and covered by the FN-DSA signature. Header
values for `origin_ts_at` MUST contain only an unsigned base-10 integer
representation. The `sig` parameter value is the unpadded base64-encoded FN-DSA
signature. Malformed headers (invalid base64, missing required parameters, or
unparsable syntax) MUST be treated as absent for enforcement purposes and SHOULD
be logged.

For live requests, receiving servers MUST reject the `X-Matrix-PQC` header for
enforcement purposes if `origin_ts_at` differs from the receiver's local clock
by more than 5 minutes. This bounds replay and makes the signed timestamp
meaningful for key-expiry evaluation; it does not let the origin extend an
expired or closed key's accepted lifetime.

This MSC introduces the header with advisory-but-verified semantics:

- Receiving servers that support this MSC MUST verify the `X-Matrix-PQC` header
  whenever it is present and the sending server has a published FN-DSA key.
- A verification failure SHOULD be logged as a warning but MUST NOT cause
  request rejection, provided the Ed25519 `Authorization` header is valid.
- If a receiving server has already cached an FN-DSA key for the sending server,
  absence of the `X-Matrix-PQC` header on requests from that server SHOULD be
  logged as a potential downgrade indicator.
- Implementations MAY offer an operator-level strict mode that rejects requests
  lacking valid PQC transport authentication from peers with cached FN-DSA keys.
  Strict mode MUST be configurable because legacy servers and advisory-period
  deployments may omit `X-Matrix-PQC` even when the Ed25519 `Authorization`
  header is valid.
- Legacy servers that do not support this MSC ignore the `X-Matrix-PQC` header
  entirely.

Mandatory room-scoped enforcement is defined by MSC00E2. Optional session
amortization that replaces per-request FN-DSA signatures with a negotiated MAC
is defined by MSC00E5. The Ed25519 `Authorization` header remains required on
all federation requests as long as any legacy room version exists in the
federation.

## Detached notary provenance bundles

Notary-specific provenance material MUST be carried outside the origin key
object. A notary MAY retain and redistribute a detached provenance bundle
describing how it observed a key, but such a bundle is never required for the
validity of the underlying key object and MUST NOT be treated as part of the
minting flow.

This preserves a single canonical origin key package signing object: the object
fetched directly from the origin and the object redistributed by a notary remain
equivalent after removing `signatures` and `unsigned` and applying Matrix
Canonical JSON serialization, and therefore hash to the same
`server_key_package_sha256`. A notary response may add its own signatures,
observation records, or references to detached artifacts, so raw wire JSON and
full response objects are not expected to be byte-for-byte identical.

Notary-specific provenance data such as local fetch timestamps, retained TLS
evidence, challenge/proof artifacts from any optional local anti-spam workflow,
and audit notes MUST be carried outside the origin key object, either in
notary-signed observation records or in a separately retained provenance bundle.
They MUST NOT affect the canonical hash or signature input of the origin key
package.

Detached provenance bundles are advisory provenance. A notary MAY retain them,
serve them on demand, or include stable digests of them in a signed observation,
but other receivers MUST NOT reject an otherwise-valid FN-DSA key object solely
because such detached provenance metadata is absent, delayed, too fast, or too
slow.

## Notary expectations and key validity

Key notaries (`/_matrix/key/v2/query`) MUST include FN-DSA keys and their
corresponding signatures in responses when present on the queried server.
Notaries MUST validate the remote server's FN-DSA self-signature for the queried
`server_name`, recompute and validate the minting-derived `short_key_id` from
the advertised key body, `server_name`, proof nonce, and canonical proof
solution, and verify the proof-of-work as specified in
[profile-bound key minting](#canonical-key-object) before attesting to the key;
if any check fails, the notary MUST NOT include that FN-DSA key in its response.
Notary responses are themselves signed objects; notaries that support this MSC
MUST include FN-DSA signatures on their responses.

Before attesting to an FN-DSA key, a notary MUST also check its retained
observations for the same `(server_name, algorithm, short_key_id)` with a
different `key_id`. If such a conflict is known to that notary, it MUST NOT emit
a normal attestation for the new key body and SHOULD retain or emit advisory
equivocation evidence instead. This check certifies only "no collision known to
this notary at the time of attestation"; it MUST NOT be described as a global
non-collision guarantee.

**Interaction with querying servers.** A suppressed attestation means only that
this specific `key_id` carries no attestation in the response; it MUST NOT be
treated as grounds to reject the response as a whole, and other keys and records
in the same response remain independently valid. A querying server that receives
an accompanying `notary_equivocations` record SHOULD parse and log it to alert
operators to the conflict, rather than treating the missing attestation as an
unremarkable cache miss. Beyond that alerting, the record creates no new
obligation: the querying server proceeds exactly as it would for any other key
this notary could not supply, subject to its own existing fetch and
negative-caching behavior — this MSC does not require an immediate direct fetch
on top of that, since mandating one would hand an attacker a free
network-amplification lever against a dead or unresponsive origin. If no valid
key is ultimately obtained by any means, the dependent signature simply fails
verification, consistent with the advisory-only invariant below: equivocation
evidence informs operators, and never substitutes for, forces, or blocks a
verification outcome.

A notary MUST NOT add, remove, reorder, or rewrite any member of the origin key
object other than adding entries under `signatures`. As a conformance check,
`server_key_package_sha256` recomputed from a notary-redistributed key object
after removing `signatures` and `unsigned` MUST equal the digest recomputed from
a direct origin fetch of the same response snapshot.

### Notary observations

Notaries MAY include `notary_observations` records describing how they observed
an FN-DSA key. These records are signed provenance metadata: they let operators
and later auditors verify that a named notary claims to have fetched a specific
server key over HTTPS at a specific time and under a specific TLS certificate
context.

Notary observations are strictly advisory. They are not a substitute for Matrix
server-key validation and MUST NOT change acceptance semantics.

```json
{
  "notary_observations": [
    {
      "notary_server_name": "notary.example",

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The observation signature input is the following byte string:

```text
len16("matrix:notary-key-observation:v1") ||
"matrix:notary-key-observation:v1" ||
len16(notary_server_name) ||
notary_server_name ||
len16(observed_server_name) ||

if provenance_bundle_sha256_present:
    len16(provenance_bundle_sha256) ||
    provenance_bundle_sha256 ||
uint64_be(valid_until_ts)
```

Formatting definitions:

- `len16(x)` is the two-byte big-endian length of the UTF-8 byte string `x`,
  followed immediately by `x`.
- `uint64_be(ts)` is an unsigned 64-bit big-endian millisecond timestamp.
- `leaf_spki_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the TLS
  leaf certificate's SubjectPublicKeyInfo DER.
- `leaf_cert_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the
  full TLS leaf certificate DER observed by the notary during its HTTPS fetch.
- `server_key_package_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest
  of the observed origin server-key package's Matrix Canonical JSON
  representation after removing only `signatures` and `unsigned`.
- When `provenance_bundle_sha256` is present, it is the unpadded
  base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of a detached notary provenance bundle
  retained by that notary for this observation. The bundle format is
  notary-defined, but any challenge/proof artifacts, retained transcript
  evidence, or audit notes linked from a signed observation MUST live there
  rather than inside the origin key object.

Notary and verifier constraints:

- A notary MUST NOT emit an observation unless it performed the described fetch
  itself.
- Verifiers MAY validate and store these records for diagnostics, audits, and
  operator review.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST verify the notary's signature
  using the notary's Matrix server signing key.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST check that
  `observed_server_name` matches the queried `server_name`.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST check that `key_id` and
  `valid_until_ts` match the observed key response described by the record.
- When validating an observation, a verifier MUST check that
  `server_key_package_sha256` matches the observed key response described by the
  record.
- When `provenance_bundle_sha256` is present, a verifier MAY fetch or inspect
  the detached bundle out of band for diagnostics or audit. This reference is
  advisory and MUST NOT change automated key acceptance semantics.

### TLS 1.3 compact provenance

`tls_13_provenance` MUST be omitted for non-TLS-1.3 fetches. When
`tls_13_provenance` is present, `transport` MUST be `https`, `leaf_spki_sha256`
and `leaf_cert_sha256` MUST be present, and `tls_13_provenance_sha256` is the
unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the following byte string:

```text
len16("matrix:tls13-provenance:v1") ||
"matrix:tls13-provenance:v1" ||
len16(transcript_hash_algorithm) ||
transcript_hash_algorithm ||
len16(handshake_transcript_hash) ||
handshake_transcript_hash ||
len16(certificate_verify_signature_scheme) ||
certificate_verify_signature_scheme ||
len32(server_certificate_verify_signature) ||
server_certificate_verify_signature
```

Formatting definitions:

- `len32(x)` is the four-byte big-endian length of the byte string `x`, followed
  immediately by `x`.
- `handshake_transcript_hash` is the literal cryptographic hash of the TLS 1.3
  Handshake Context up to but excluding the server `CertificateVerify` message,
  as defined by RFC 8446 Section 4.4.1, encoded as unpadded base64url.
- The `handshake_transcript_hash` calculation uses raw TLS Handshake messages
  and excludes TLS record-layer headers.
- `transcript_hash_algorithm` MUST be the hash algorithm of the negotiated TLS
  1.3 cipher suite.
- `certificate_verify_signature_scheme` MUST be a TLS `SignatureScheme` registry
  name.
- `server_certificate_verify_signature` is the literal TLS 1.3
  `CertificateVerify` signature, encoded as unpadded base64url.
- This compact construction intentionally does not carry the full handshake
  transcript.

Validation requirements:

- A verifier or auditor validating compact `tls_13_provenance` MUST obtain a TLS
  leaf certificate matching `leaf_cert_sha256` and `leaf_spki_sha256`, for
  example from Certificate Transparency logs, out-of-band certificate evidence,
  or a retained notary audit bundle.
- The verifier MUST verify `server_certificate_verify_signature` according to
  the TLS 1.3 `CertificateVerify` construction for the server context in RFC
  8446 Section 4.4.3, using the signed content formed from 64 bytes of `0x20`,
  the ASCII context string `TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify`, a single `0x00`
  byte, and the stated `handshake_transcript_hash`.
- Verifiers SHOULD validate that the obtained leaf certificate chains to the
  WebPKI and was valid for `observed_server_name` at `observed_at`, including
  Certificate Transparency evidence where available.

Trust and enforcement boundaries:

- Compact TLS 1.3 provenance proves only that the notary presents evidence that
  the holder of the obtained TLS certificate private key produced a valid
  `CertificateVerify` signature over the stated transcript hash.
- Compact TLS 1.3 provenance does not prove that the TLS evidence was captured
  at `observed_at`; it proves only that the certificate key holder signed the
  stated transcript hash at some time. Freshness beyond the notary's signed
  assertion requires retained transcript evidence or a stronger transcript
  verification system.
- Compact TLS 1.3 provenance does not prove that the HTTP response body was
  faithfully reported by the notary; proving payload fidelity without trusting
  the notary requires a separate TLS transcript-verification system such as
  TLSNotary or DECO.
- Closing this gap by binding the application payload to the TLS session itself
  — an RFC 9266 `tls-exporter` value, an X.509 cross-signature over the Matrix
  key body using the TLS certificate's private key, or a DNS TXT record at the
  domain (DNSSEC-backed or not) — was considered and deliberately excluded from
  this MSC. An exporter binding or an X.509 cross-signature both require the
  Matrix daemon to hold TLS session or private key material it typically does
  not have when deployed behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy, HAProxy). A DNS
  TXT record adds no cryptographic assurance beyond the WebPKI validation
  `tls_13_provenance` already provides — an unsigned record is spoofable by the
  same on-path attacker already assumed in this MSC's threat model, and a
  notary-reported TXT observation is exactly as forgeable as any other bare
  notary claim, i.e. it could not be given weight in the corroboration tier
  without recreating the live-oracle problem the `notary_equivocations` design
  avoids. DNSSEC would close the spoofing gap for the TXT approach but is
  unevenly deployed across origin domains, so it cannot serve as a baseline
  mechanism. Closing this class of gap in general requires an MPC-based
  transcript-verification system such as TLSNotary or DECO (see above), which is
  out of scope for this MSC.
- Because the compact form carries only the transcript hash, it does not by
  itself let a later auditor inspect or recompute the handshake transcript,
  confirm the SNI value, confirm detached notary workflow artifacts, or confirm
  other handshake contents.
- A notary that wants independently auditable transcript contents MAY retain or
  publish the full TLS Handshake messages, or equivalent transcript evidence, in
  an out-of-band audit bundle. Such transcript evidence MUST use the same RFC
  8446 Section 4.4.1 Handshake Context definition and MUST exclude TLS
  record-layer headers.
- `tls_13_provenance` remains advisory provenance metadata and MUST NOT affect
  automated key acceptance, event acceptance, or state resolution.
- Non-normatively, compact TLS 1.3 provenance is intended as low-cost forensic
  evidence attached to a signed notary observation. The notary's own signature
  binds the observation timestamp, observed server name, certificate
  fingerprints, key fingerprint, and TLS provenance digest to that notary's
  identity; the TLS evidence then helps distinguish an actual TLS-origin
  observation from a purely invented certificate claim. It is not intended to
  make homeservers parse TLS handshakes, enforce freshness automatically, or
  treat the notary observation as machine-verifiable proof of HTTP payload
  fidelity.

FN-DSA keys follow identical validity semantics to Ed25519 keys: a signature
made by `fndsa512:<short_key_id>` is valid if the key was valid at the time of
the signed operation. Retired FN-DSA keys appear in `old_verify_keys` with an
`expired_ts`. The `valid_until_ts` field governs cache lifetime for the entire
key response, identically to existing behavior.

### Notary equivocation evidence

When a notary observes conflicting FN-DSA key material for the same
`(server_name, algorithm, short_key_id)` with a different `key_id` (see
[Notary expectations and key validity](#notary-expectations-and-key-validity)),
it SHOULD retain or emit a `notary_equivocations` record documenting the
conflict, alongside `server_keys` and `notary_observations` in
`/_matrix/key/v2/query` responses, and in the body of a `409 M_CONFLICT`
response body or in any detached provenance artifact the notary serves.

`M_CONFLICT` is introduced by this MSC for this use case. A `409 M_CONFLICT`
response means the notary or receiver has already observed a different
minting-valid FN-DSA key body for the same
`(server_name, algorithm, short_key_id)` tuple and is refusing to treat the new
body as an acceptable binding for that tuple. The response SHOULD include
`notary_equivocations` records when the responder has signed evidence it is
willing to disclose.

A bare record is only a notary's claim that it observed both key bodies — any
consumer must trust the notary to believe it. But because each conflicting
`/_matrix/key/v2/server` response is itself self-signed by the origin, two such
responses for the same key ID constitute a self-contained, non-repudiable proof
of equivocation, verifiable by any third party without trusting the notary at
all — the same role a certificate-transparency misissuance proof or a
proof-of-stake slashing proof plays in other systems. `notary_equivocations` is
therefore an attestation by default, with an optional embedded-proof upgrade:

```json
{
  "notary_equivocations": [
    {
      "record_version": 1,
      "observed_server_name": "example.com",
      "algorithm": "fndsa512",

      },

        "server_key_package_sha256": "<unpadded-base64url-sha256>",
        "first_observed_ts": 1798848600000,
        "observed_via": "notary"
      },
      "first_response": { "...": "optional, full origin key response" },
      "conflicting_response": {
        "...": "optional, full origin key response"
      },
      "notary_server_name": "notary.example",
      "signatures": {
        "notary.example": {
          "ed25519:auto": "<base64-ed25519-signature>",
          "fndsa512:9f3c1ade47b0c2915e6d8a3f10bb47d2": "<base64-fn-dsa-signature>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Field semantics:

- `record_version` is `1` for this shape.
- `observed_server_name`, `algorithm`, and `short_key_id` identify the
  equivocating origin and the colliding key family.
- `first` and `conflicting` are each an observation of one of the two
  conflicting key bodies. Despite the naming, the pair is unordered for dedup
  purposes (see below); `first` denotes whichever observation this notary
  learned of earlier, per its own `first_observed_ts`.
- `key_id` in each observation is the canonical `fndsa512:<short_key_id>`
  identifier for that key body, derived as specified in
  [profile-bound key minting](#canonical-key-object).
- `server_key_package_sha256` is the unpadded base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest
  of that observation's origin `/_matrix/key/v2/server` response, after Matrix
  Canonical JSON serialization with `signatures` and `unsigned` removed,
  identical in construction to the field of the same name in
  [Notary observations](#notary-observations).
- `first_observed_ts` is this notary's own local timestamp of first observing
  that key body under this identity tuple. It establishes ordering only; it is
  not carried forward from any other server's notion of time.
- `observed_via` is `direct` if the notary itself fetched that key body directly
  from the origin over `/_matrix/key/v2/server`, or `notary` if it learned that
  key body via another notary or via federation gossip. This matters for
  provenance: two conflicting `direct` observations are the strongest possible
  signal (the origin genuinely equivocated, or was compromised twice), whereas a
  `notary`-sourced observation may instead reflect a poisoned upstream notary
  rather than origin misbehavior. Consumers of a record MUST take `observed_via`
  into account when judging its strength and MUST NOT treat a `notary`-sourced
  observation as equivalent evidence to a `direct` one.
- `first_response` and `conflicting_response` are OPTIONAL full origin
  `/_matrix/key/v2/server` response bodies for the corresponding observation,
  present only when the notary chooses to embed the proof upgrade (see below).
  When present, each MUST be the exact response the digest in the sibling
  `server_key_package_sha256` was computed from.
- One entry appearing only in `old_verify_keys` (rather than `verify_keys`) is
  attested by the origin's _current_ signing key at the time of that response,
  not by the retired key itself. The embedded response is still origin-signed
  and still constitutes proof of equivocation, but verifiers should note this
  proves "the origin's current key vouched for this historical binding," a
  marginally weaker statement than a live self-signature by the historical key.

The embedded-proof upgrade: a notary MAY include `first_response` and
`conflicting_response` to let any third party verify the equivocation without
trusting the notary, by checking each embedded response's own self-signature
against the key body it contains — no external material is needed. Because each
embedded response is a few KB, a single `/_matrix/key/v2/query` response or
`409 M_CONFLICT` body MUST NOT include more than 10 records carrying embedded
responses; any additional qualifying records in that same response MUST omit
`first_response` and `conflicting_response` and carry only the hash-referenced
attestation fields.

Signing and identity:

- Each record is signed individually by the notary, not the enclosing array, so
  that a record survives being relayed, cached, or re-served individually by
  downstream tooling without losing its own attestation.
- The signature input is the following byte string, computed over the record
  with `signatures` (and, when present, `first_response`/`conflicting_response`)
  excluded:

```text
len16("matrix:notary-equivocation:v1") ||
"matrix:notary-equivocation:v1" ||
uint8(record_version) ||
len16(notary_server_name) ||
notary_server_name ||
len16(observed_server_name) ||
observed_server_name ||
len16(algorithm) ||

len16(short_key_id) ||

conflicting.server_key_package_sha256 ||
uint64_be(conflicting.first_observed_ts) ||
len16(conflicting.observed_via) ||
conflicting.observed_via
```

`len16`, `uint8`, and `uint64_be` are as defined in
[Notary observations](#notary-observations). Embedded full responses, when
present, are not covered by this signature input; their integrity is instead
verified independently via each embedded response's own self-signature, matched
against `server_key_package_sha256`.

- Dedup identity: a record is identified by the tuple
  `(observed_server_name, algorithm, short_key_id, first.key_id, conflicting.key_id)`,
  with the `key_id` pair treated as unordered. A notary MUST NOT emit more than
  one record for the same identity within a single response; consumers
  aggregating records from multiple sources or over time MUST deduplicate on
  this identity.
- Retention: notaries SHOULD retain equivocation records at least as long as
  either of the involved key bindings remains retained locally. This MSC does
  not define any further retention mandate, reputation semantics, or gossip
  protocol for these records.

Verifier constraints:

- A verifier MUST validate the notary's signature over the record using the
  notary's Matrix server signing key before trusting the attestation.
- A verifier validating an embedded-proof record MUST independently verify each
  of `first_response` and `conflicting_response` against its own self-signature
  and MUST check that each hashes (after Canonical JSON serialization with
  `signatures` and `unsigned` removed) to the corresponding
  `server_key_package_sha256`. A record whose embedded responses fail this check
  MUST be treated as an unverified attestation, not as a proof, regardless of
  the notary's own signature over the record.

**The advisory-only invariant.** Equivocation evidence — whether a bare
attestation or a fully embedded, independently verified proof — is advisory
forensic material only. MSC4499 already establishes that room ACLs and other
federation-visible mechanisms MUST NOT force eviction of a cached key binding or
bypass its First Seen Wins rule; `notary_equivocations` records are exactly such
a federation-visible mechanism, so the same constraint applies to them by
construction. A receiving server MUST NOT allow a `notary_equivocations` record,
of any strength, to automatically trigger key-binding eviction, rebinding,
re-verification rollback, or any other deviation from First Seen Wins. Without
this constraint, an equivocation record — forged or genuine — mailed to every
peer would become precisely the federated eviction-forcing vector that MSC4499's
permanent-binding rule was designed to close. Equivocation evidence may inform a
human operator deciding whether to use the manual cache-eviction mechanism; it
MUST NOT, by itself, inform the cache.

### Self-signed expiry claim carriage

Notaries MAY include valid `m.server_key.expiry.v1` expiry claims observed from
the origin or from federation gossip in a top-level `expiry_claims` array
alongside `server_keys` and `notary_observations` in `/_matrix/key/v2/query`
responses. During the unstable period, the claim type is
`tk.nutra.msc45xx.server_key.expiry.v1`. A notary MUST verify the claim's
signatures, `server_name`, and `key_id` binding before redistributing it. A
notary that has observed a valid expiry claim for a key it returns MUST include
that claim. Notary redistribution does not make the claim notary specific:
receivers continue to authenticate the claim by its own signatures and use the
smallest observed `not_valid_after_ts` for the closed key as specified by this
MSC family. If an enclosing `old_verify_keys` wrapper carries a later
`expired_ts` for the same key, the earlier self-signed expiry claim wins.

Any third-party attestation metadata a server or notary chooses to additionally
track (e.g. historic corroboration records, reputation signals) is advisory
only. Servers MUST NOT reject events, keys, or state based solely on missing,
false, suspicious, flimsy, or otherwise invalid attestation metadata. Such
metadata MUST NOT affect automated verification, acceptance, or state
resolution. If it is to influence behavior at all, that MUST occur only through
explicit admin override or manual operator intervention. Automated state
resolution MUST continue to operate normally, remain backwards compatible with
legacy federation traffic, and converge according to the established network
rules.

Because a server's very first FN-DSA key observation is TOFU and authenticates
only via the existing Ed25519 trust model and MSC4499 First Seen Wins semantics,
it is vulnerable to an attacker positioned on that specific fetch path — a
targeted, localized man-in-the-middle rather than a global compromise.
Implementations MUST NOT treat contradictory notary observations, by themselves,
as sufficient to reject or invalidate an otherwise valid first observation:
doing so would let any false, compromised, or stale notary create a
denial-of-service condition against legitimate bootstrap. This MSC therefore
leaves first-observation acceptance semantics aligned with the existing Matrix
server-key trust model and MSC4499; it does not define any cross-source
consensus or conflict-resolution mechanism for FN-DSA bootstrap.
